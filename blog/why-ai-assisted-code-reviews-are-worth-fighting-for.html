    <h1>Why AI-Assisted Code Reviews Are Worth Fighting For</h1>
    <p>By Ed Dogan – AI + Frontend Engineering Leader</p>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Code reviews are a critical part of engineering quality control — but in reality, they’re far from perfect. Reviews pile up, cycle times stretch, and quality tends to dip during crunch time at the end of a sprint. MR feedback can be inconsistent, overly focused on style, or influenced by who’s reviewing rather than what’s in the code.</p>
    <p>And in larger organizations… bureaucracy and permission gates can make integrating anything new — especially AI — (get it?) feel like trying to turn a cargo ship with a paddle.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>MR cycle times are a key metric and followed closely by most of the seasoned managers to identify even the cultural problems within an engineering team.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Senior engineers are pulled into too many parallel reviews… their feedback becomes rushed.</li>
      <li>Or sometimes they fall in love with the way they do things, and create their own bubbles</li> 
      <li>Junior engineers hold back, unsure if their comments add value.</li>
      <li>End-of-sprint crunch means less thoughtful reviews and more “just get it merged” decisions..</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The result: delayed feedback, missed issues, and a gradual erosion of quality.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Where AI Fits In</h2>
    <p>It can...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Catch logic errors that “look fine” to human eyes.</li>
      <li>Flag deviations from code style or architecture guidelines automatically.</li>
      <li>Give junior engineers a safety net so they contribute earlier and more confidently.</li>
      <li>Let senior engineers focus on architectural concerns instead of nitpicking syntax.</li>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>A Practical Experiment</h2>
    <p>During a company hackathon, I built an internal AI Code Reviewer that connects to GitLab MRs and uses Sourcegraph’s Cody AI. It’s trained on our codebase, styles, and architecture so it gives actionable, relevant feedback, not generic “best practices” nonsense.</p>
    <p>Due to authorization restrictions, we couldn’t fully wire it into GitLab yet… but it works locally, and several engineers are already using it to pre-review their MRs before pushing. It shortens the review back-and-forth, catches subtle mistakes, and sparks better conversations in the actual review stage.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>As AI-assisted coding grows, AI-assisted reviewing will naturally follow. If more code is generated by machines, then equally capable machines need to be checking it.</p>
    <p>For engineering management, this isn’t about chasing shiny tools, but it’s about moving core metrics in the right direction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shorter MR cycle times</li>
      <li>Higher review coverage</li>
      <li>Fewer post-merge defects (Yeah, I know your tests are supposed to do this.)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>An AI-powered reviewer won’t replace human judgment — but it can raise the floor for everyone.</p>
    <p>I wonder if we'll get to a time where an AI approved MR will be merged without a worry though, what do you think?</p>
