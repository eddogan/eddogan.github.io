    <h1>Impressive Demos, Unreliable Products</h1>
    <p>When Google’s AI Leadership Asks for the Wrong Improvements – By Ed Dogan</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>Over the long weekend, I decided to give Google's AI toys another chance. They've been trying hard and had some impressive demos especially with <strong>"Nano banana"</strong>. 
      The test was of course against my favorite coder <strong>Claude</strong>. I gave them the same prompt — build a simple memory game app — and watched how they approached it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The setup</h2>
    <p>The rules were simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Same prompt for both models.</li>
      <li>Goal: Build a mobile memory game deployable to Google PlayStore.</li>
      <li>Explicit instruction at the end: “If you have any questions, ask me first.”</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Google AI Studio</h2>
    <p>Google’s assistant jumped straight into coding without asking a single clarifying question. It built the app in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, despite my instructions that it would need to be deployed to the Google Play Store.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time Taken:</strong> ~2 minutes 11 seconds (including ~35 seconds of debugging)</li>
      <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Prioritized speed above everything else</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> The game ran initially but <em>crashed after finding the first pair</em></li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Claude</h2>
    <p>Claude, on the other hand, paused to ask <strong>four clarifying questions</strong> — even asking me what the game should be called. It then built the app with <strong>create-react-expo</strong>, a framework better suited for mobile deployment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time Taken:</strong> ~7 minutes 30 seconds to build, plus ~4 minutes 40 seconds to run & test (including waiting for my approvals)</li>
      <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Focused on intent alignment and usability</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> The game worked almost perfectly, only minor bug was with animations blocking clicks.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Tradeoff</h2>
    <blockquote>In real-world engineering, picking the right tradeoff is the most important</blockquote>
    <p>I did not stop at Code Assistant and played with many of the impressive assistants they have. Speed was unmatched. Nano banana created a very complicated background asset (it wasnt usable and old games style but followed the prompt) for my game in 11 secs. It was clear, Google threw everything at speed.</p>
    <p>The leadership decision to go for speed was so obviously glaring...</p>
    <p>OpenAI has been doing the same thing, throwing a lot of their efforts at improving speed. But I don't think it's the way to lead the AI revolution.</p> 
    <p>Faster demos with an unstable product when you dig deeper is how you kill your AI products. AI leaders should focus more on reliability and alignment when we're going towards the AI future.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This experiment reminded me that the way leadership frames <strong>success for AI teams</strong> has massive downstream effects. Optimizing only for speed might win the demo, but optimizing for accuracy builds tools that we can actually trust.</p>
    <p><strong>Impressive demos, unreliable products.</strong> That’s not the future I want to build.</p>
