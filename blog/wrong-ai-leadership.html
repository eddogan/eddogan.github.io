    <h1>Impressive Demos, Unreliable Products</h1>
    <p>When Google’s AI Leadership Asks for the Wrong Improvements – By Ed Dogan</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>Over the long weekend, I decided to give Google's AI toys another chance. They've been trying hard and had some impressive demos especially with <strong>"Nano banana"</strong>. 
      The test was of course against my favorite coder <strong>Claude</strong>. I gave them the same prompt — build a simple memory game app — and watched how they approached it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The setup</h2>
    <p>The rules were simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Same prompt for both models.</li>
      <li>Goal: Build a mobile memory game deployable to Google PlayStore.</li>
      <li>Explicit instruction at the end: “If you have any questions, ask me first.”</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Google AI Studio</h2>
    <p>Google’s assistant jumped straight into coding without asking a single clarifying question. It built the app in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, despite my instructions that it would need to be deployed to the Google Play Store.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time Taken:</strong> ~2 minutes 11 seconds (including ~35 seconds of debugging)</li>
      <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Prioritized speed above everything else</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> The game ran initially but <em>crashed after finding the first pair</em></li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Claude</h2>
    <p>Claude, on the other hand, paused to ask <strong>four clarifying questions</strong> — even asking me what the game should be called. It then built the app with <strong>create-react-expo</strong>, a framework better suited for mobile deployment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time Taken:</strong> ~7 minutes 30 seconds to build, plus ~4 minutes 40 seconds to run & test (including waiting for my approvals)</li>
      <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Focused on intent alignment and usability</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> The game worked almost perfectly, only minor bug was with animations blocking clicks.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Tradeoff</h2>
    <blockquote>In real-world engineering, choosing the right tradeoff is everything</blockquote>
    <p>I did not stop at Code Assistant and played with many of the impressive assistants they have. Speed was unmatched. For example, Nano Banana generated a complex game background asset in just <strong>11 seconds</strong>. It wasn’t usable (looked like something from an old game), but it did follow the prompt. The pattern was clear: Google has thrown everything at speed.</p>
    <p>This is not an accident — it’s a leadership decision. And it was glaring...</p>
    <p>OpenAI has been heading down a similar path, pouring effort into shaving seconds off response times. But I don't think it's the way to lead the AI revolution.</p> 
    <p><strong>Faster demos with unstable products is a recipe for failure.</strong> If we want AI to become a foundation of real-world software, leaders should be pushing for <em>reliability</em> and <em>alignment</em> over raw speed. Otherwise, the trust gap will swallow the hype.</p>
