  <section class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>An internal AI code reviewer that delivers actionable suggestions on merge requests, improving code quality and speeding up initial MR response times.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Code review was a bottleneck in our development process. Junior engineers often hesitated to give feedback, while senior engineers risked getting stuck in established patterns. AI-assisted coding was becoming more common in our team, but code reviews lagged behind in quality control.</p>
    <p>AI could catch issues invisible to the human eye — especially subtle syntax or structural errors that looked correct but produced incorrect results. This made automated, intelligent code review an opportunity for both quality and efficiency gains.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>I built an AI assistant that understands our codebase, style guides, standards, and architecture, and can provide practical, context-aware review comments.</p>
    <p>We use Sourcegraph’s Cody AI and GitLab, so I designed a tool that integrates Cody CLI into our GitLab workflow. The prototype was built in Python, with the goal of automating high-quality MR feedback.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>My Role & Leadership</h2>
    <p>This was a one-week hackathon project I initiated and developed myself. I partnered with the infrastructure team to gain API access to GitLab and handled all coding independently.</p>
    <p>Although full GitLab integration was blocked by company authorization rules, I secured leadership buy-in to revisit the integration at the next hackathon. In its current form, the tool runs locally, enabling engineers to review their own code or others’ before pushing changes.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>The tool was quickly adopted by junior engineers, who valued the structured, confidence-boosting feedback. It sparked discussions on further enhancements and showed clear potential for improving consistency and code quality across the team.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Posts AI-generated MR reviews directly from the CLI</li>
      <li>Customizable prompts based on reviewer preferences</li>
      <li>Outputs structured, enumerated feedback points</li>
      <li>Option to skip or post each suggestion individually so they can be tracked as separate issues</li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Adoption is as much a cultural challenge as a technical one — some senior engineers were resistant to change, but AI can reduce costly human mistakes and elevate the overall quality of the codebase.</p>
